# ProductClusteringAnalysis
Unsupervised learning project to segment products using clustering techniques. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and clustering visualization. Built with Python 3.10+ and Jupyter Notebook to assist businesses in strategy development.
# Product Clustering Analysis

This project applies unsupervised learning to segment products based on their attributes and sales data. By grouping similar products, it provides actionable insights to support data-driven business strategies.

## Overview
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on sales, profits, costs, and product attributes from stores across different regions. The aim is to perform clustering analysis and present clear, meaningful segments.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
  - Identify trends in product sales and profitability.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Scale and transform features for clustering algorithms.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Add, reduce, or manipulate features with clear rationale.
- **Clustering Techniques:**
  - Use existing libraries for clustering algorithms.
  - Visualize clusters and provide business-relevant summaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or above
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter
